  <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
  <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
    <br>JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm.
    <br>It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation and first-class functions.
    <br>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
    <br>Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[13] often incorporating third-party libraries.
    <br>All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.

  <p style="margin-top:45px;">As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
    <br>It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
    <br>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
    <br>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications.
    <br>The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
    <br>Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
